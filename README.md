# Project Name: Plant vs. Zombie Game

## Description:
This project is a simplified version of the popular game "Plant vs. Zombies". It is implemented using the Pygame library in Python. The code creates a game window where the player can defend their garden from zombies by shooting bullets at them. The objective is to prevent the zombies from reaching the left side of the screen.

## Instructions:
To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Pygame installed on your system.
2. Copy all the code into a Python file (e.g., `GameCode.py`).
3. Ensure that the image files referenced in the code are present in the correct path or update the file paths accordingly.
4. Execute the Python file (`GameCode.py`).
5. The game window will open, displaying the garden as the background.
6. Zombies will spawn from the right side of the screen and move towards the left.
7. Use the mouse to aim and click to shoot bullets at the zombies.
8. If a bullet collides with a zombie, the zombie's health will decrease. Once a zombie's health reaches zero, it will be removed from the game.
9. If a zombie reaches the left side of the screen, the game will end.
10. The game window will close automatically after the game ends.

Feel free to modify the code to add more features, levels, or enhancements to the gameplay.
